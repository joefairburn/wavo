import BasicWaveform from "./components/basic-waveform";
import basicWaveformCode from "./components/basic-waveform.tsx?raw";
import WaveformWithProgress from "./components/waveform-with-progress";
import waveformWithProgressCode from "./components/waveform-with-progress.tsx?raw";
import DemoCard from "@docs/components/demo-card.astro";

## Basic Usage

Import and use wavo in your React components:

<DemoCard class="p-0" code={basicWaveformCode} lang="ts" title="BasicWaveform">
  <BasicWaveform client:load />
</DemoCard>

## Adding Playback Progress

To show playback progress, add the `Progress` component and pass a `progress` prop (value between 0 and 1):

<DemoCard class="p-0" code={waveformWithProgressCode} lang="ts" title="WaveformWithProgress">
  <WaveformWithProgress client:load />
</DemoCard>
